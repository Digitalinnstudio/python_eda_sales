## 🔍 Product Performance Analysis

### Top Products Overview
| Metric | Dominant Product Types | Insight |
|--------|------------------------|----------|
| **Sales** | High-value electronics and furniture (Smart Phones, Canon Copiers, Leather Armchairs) | These products drive the majority of total revenue. |
| **Quantity Sold** | Low-cost office supplies (Staples, File Carts, Pencil Sharpeners) | High-volume, low-unit-price items dominate here. |
| **Profit** | Mix of premium electronics and niche furniture (Canon Copiers, Smart Phones, Hoover Stove, Sauder Bookcase) | Products with strong margins, not necessarily top sellers. |

---

### Key Insights
- **High Sales vs. High Quantity Discrepancy:**  
  No overlap between the top selling (by revenue) and top selling (by quantity) products. This highlights two distinct business strategies:
  - High value, low volume premium goods.  
  - Low value, high volume essentials.

- **Sales & Profit Alignment:**  
  Products like the Canon Copier and premium smartphones appear in both top sales and top profit lists showing they are reliable revenue and profit drivers.

- **High-Margin Niche Products:**  
  Hoover Stove and Sauder Bookcase deliver strong profits despite modest sales volume ideal for focused marketing.


**Conclusion:**  
The business relies heavily on high value electronics and furniture for profitability, while office essentials sustain steady sales volume. A balanced strategy across these segments is key for growth.

## 💸 Discount Impact Analysis

### Relationship Between Discounts, Sales, and Profit
The data shows a trade off between sales volume and profitability as discount levels increase.

| Factor | Effect of Increasing Discount | Insight |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------|
| **Sales Volume** | 📈 Increases | Discounts successfully drive higher sales. |
| **Profit Margin** | 📉 Decreases (often negative beyond ~0.3) | Profit erosion outweighs sales growth after moderate discount levels. |

### Key Observations
- **Low Discounts (0.0–0.1):**  
  Often lead to both higher sales and positive profits, suggesting that minor incentives work best.
- **Moderate Discounts (0.2–0.3):**  
  Sales rise, but profits begin to drop significantly.
- **High Discounts (>0.3):**  
  Lead to consistent losses higher sales volume cannot offset reduced margins.

**Conclusion:**  
While small discounts can effectively increase sales and maintain profitability, aggressive discounting (>30%) destroys profit margins The optimal strategy is to offer moderate discounts that stimulate sales without eroding profitability.
